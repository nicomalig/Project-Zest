Thanks for visiting our GitHub Page. Team Happy Cappy is excited to deliver Project Zest, a web-based recipe management tool. To be notified of our progress on the development of this time-saving tool, [visit our website](https://projectze.st)!

### Problem Space
When people are cooking, they often have to go to Google in order to convert units or do calculations to alter recipe proportions. This takes up a lot of time, so we built Zest to create a seamless cooking experience. People are able to convert units, alter recipes, and save modified recipes from a single platform; increasing convenience and cook time.

### Solution
Project Zest is a fully-featured web application that allows people to cook without the hassle of doing any complicated conversions. Zest allows users to quickly
1. alter proportion sizes
2. change units
3. save modified recipes
Rather than juggling multiple sites, cook books, and calculators, you can do everything within Zest at a click of a button. 

### Use Case
Imagine a user is trying to cook a recipe for chicken noodle soup, but is encountering many common cooking issues. A recipe they found has ingredients and directions for 2 servings, but our aspiring chef needs to serve a family of 7. Performing such computations is time consuming and it's almost dinnertime, but yet another problem comes up. Our user's recipe calls for carrots, but is there is a picky eater tonight!


_Zest is designed to intuitively collect recipe information and deliver instant calculations. It's designed around the user and easily adapts the recipe to the user's preferences. Ingredients can be removed, added, or adjusted. As is often needed, units can be converted on the fly. For example, tablespoons to teaspoons or cups to ounces! Don't make cooking a test, use Zest!_
