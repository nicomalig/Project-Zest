## Project Zest

Thanks for visiting our GitHub Page. Team Happy Cappy is excited to deliver Project Zest, a web-based recipe management tool. To be notified of our progress on the development of this time-saving tool, [visit our website](https://projectze.st)!

### Problem Space
It's dinnertime and you or the family is hungry. You can't wait to test out this amazing recipe for Chicken Pot Pie


Project Zest aims to solve the frustrating problem of remembering, converting, or managing recipes.





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nicomalig/Project-Zest/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nicomalig/Project-Zest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
